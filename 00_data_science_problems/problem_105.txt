Good morning!

Here's today's problem:

This problem was asked by Etsy.

Assume you are given the below table on transactions from various product search results from users on Etsy. For every given product keyword, there are multiple positions that being A/B tested, and user feedback is collected on the relevance of results (from 1-5).

There are many displays for each position of every product, each of which is captured by a display_id. Define a highly relevant display as one whereby the corresponding relevance score is at least 4.

Write a query to get all products having at least one position with > 80% highly relevant displays.

product_searches
column_name	type
product	string
position	integer
display_id	integer
relevance	integer
submit_time	datetime
